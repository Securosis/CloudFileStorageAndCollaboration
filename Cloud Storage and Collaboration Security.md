Title: The Security Pro's Guide to Cloud File Storage and Collaboration

#The rise of cloud file storage and collaboration

Few technologies are invading the enterprise as rapidly as cloud file storage and collaboration services. Typically called File Sync and Share, these tools originated as consumer-grade cloud services to help people store, sync, and share files across computers and mobile devices. While we hate to dip into hyperbole, but to call these tools groundbreaking would be an understatement. Users can now access their files from any computer or device and share files with anyone, anywhere, with previously-unseen simplicity. For many consumers, it is how they define "the cloud".

These services so quickly proved their value that they inevitably made their way into the enterprise. Unfortunately, few of them were architected to support the needs and security requirements of a business. In response, many organizations simply banned and blocked them, but as always happens when a tool provides demonstrable business benefit, use is inevitable; supported or not. 

In response, enterprise-class options emerged. However, many security professionals still struggle to understand the implications of cloud storage and collaboration, and the differences between consumer and enterprise-grade services. Even though some of these services can offer superior security benefits than traditional, internal file storage.

The market is also evolving at an incredibly rapid pace, with both new features and new competitors. There is a high rate of change as everyone seeks competitive advantage in what is still a nascent, open market. 

>The category is most often called *file sync and share*, but we prefer the term *cloud file storage and collaboration* since many of the services and tools offer a lot more than basic syncing and sharing. 

Put simply, cloud file storage and collaboration services are an unavoidable disruptive innovation.

##Security implications, but also significant benefits

The risk is pretty obvious; pick the wrong service, or configure it incorrectly, and you effectively punch a hole in your firewall to allow the Internet unfettered access to your files storage. Without centralized visibility and control, employees will easily make mistakes and expose sensitive information. Choose an insecure service, and you suffer the consequences of misplaced trust and likewise expose your files. 

Now practically speaking, file security is something most organizations have struggled with since even before the Internet. However, cloud services allow us to extend those failures to the Internet at large. 

>Tools vs. Services.
>You will notice we tend to focus on cloud storage and collaboration services, and not tools you implement yourself. While tools exist to create your own private file sync and share service, we don't feel these offer the benefits of a a true cloud service. Covering both would complicate this paper, especially since most of the concerns and questions are around cloud-native services, not internal tools the replicate some of their functionality.

But pick the right service *and configure it properly*, and you can realize security benefits that are often impossible using traditional file storage options. 

By centralizing all file storage, security gains a choke point for complete control and visibility. You can track the full history of access to all files from all users and devices. You can further set enterprise-wide policies for how files are managed and shared, internally and externally. And unlike many of our security approaches, you can do so while providing the business *something they want* and are highly likely to adopt.

The alternative? Our existing troves of dozens, if not hundreds or thousands of file repositories all managed separately, with different policies, and usually lacking any real monitoring capabilities.

This paper delves into the security implications of cloud file storage and collaboration services. It covers the security fundamentals (including risks and benefits), core security features, and some of the more-advanced security features, like encryption options. We will separate out what you can expect from an enterprise-class service versus a consumer offering to help security professionals evaluate, select, and leverage the right option for their organization.

The trick is to ensure you understand the strengths and weaknesses of the services, and how to best enable security without disabling the business.
